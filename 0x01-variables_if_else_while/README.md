We're going a little deeper learning C. Today we'll be working with loops and if statements

TASK 0 This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative

TASK 1 This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

if n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if n is 0: the string and is 0
if n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

TASK 2 Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

TASK 3 Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use the putchar function (ever other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

TASK 4 Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar three times in your code

TASK 5 Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
All your code should be in the main function

TASK 6 Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar twice in your code
All your code should be in the main function

TASK 7 Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

TASK 8 Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar three times in your code

TASK 9 Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in ascending order
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

TASK 10 Write a program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
All your code should be in the main function
